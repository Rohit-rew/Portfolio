# Welcome to My portfolio project.

*Please note that this protfolio is still in development stage and will be finished soon. Also it does not contain any blogposts other than some test blogs that I posted. I will be posting all my projects here after polishing them which will take some time because they are over a 50 in total.*

###### This portfolio is built on Next JS and deployed on vercel, It will contain all the project that I will create and the blogs that I will post.

## Information about the project : 

1. The database used in the portfolio is **Firebase** which is a document model database.

2. The authentication used in the project is **NextAuth** but i am planning to use firebase authentication because of the fact that I am using firestore as my main database.

3. I have used a **CDN** in the project to store the images of the blogs and the projects, the name of the CDN is **imagekit.io** as it was free to use upto an extent, I may change or upgrade this in future as per the needs.

4. All animations used in the project are made by using a javascript library called **Framer-motion**.

5. This project uses **CKEditor**, a rich text editor to post blogs which is only accessible to the admin.


##  The project includes 5 folders (excluding the nodemodules). 

1. **Component** : It contains all the reusable components used in the project
2. **Lib** : This folder contains the reusable code for initilizing the firebase database and context api.
3. **Pages** : This is the root folder which contains all the routes within the project. There are 3 routes for the client -> 1. Home 2.Blog 3. projects. Apart from this there is one more route ->/admin which can only be accessed by admin and this is used for posting blogs and adding/deleting projects in the portfolio.
4. **Public** : This folder contains all the assest which are used in the project like the logo and other images.
5. **Styles** : This folder contains the global style sheets and some css modules.


*The admin pannel is not fully protected because the project is in the development stage yet.*

###### I also have plans to remake this project or modify this on Typescript and tailwindCSS, The reason that i did not do it is that I learned typescript and tailwind after starting this project.
