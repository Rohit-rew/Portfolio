#Hi reader , Welcome to mmy portfolio project.
# Please note that this protfolio is still in development stage and will be finished in a week after posting this readme file. 
Also it does not contain any blogposts other than some test blogs that i made.
I will be posting all my projects here after polishing them which will take some time because they are over a 50 in total.


## This portfolio is built on Next JS and deployed on vercel (free tier)  it will contain all the project that I will create and th eblogs that i will post.


## The database used in the portfolio is google's firebase/firestore which is a document model database.

## The pages folder include all the pages which are incliuded in the header of the portfolio and inside the page folder 
there is an admin folder which includes the route to the admin panel of the portfolio from where the owner(me) can make 
blogposts and add/delete projects.

## the admin pannel is not fully protected yet because the project being in the development stage yet.

## the authentication used in the project is NextAuth but i am planning to use firebase authentication because
of the fact that i am usin firestore as my main database.

## i have used a CDN in the project to store the images of the blogs and the projects the name of the CDN in imagekit.io as it was free 
to use upto an extent, I may change or upgrade this in future as per the needs.

## this project uses and rich text editor to post blogs which is only accessible to the admin(me)



## i also have plans to remake this project or modify this on Typescript and tailwindCSS, The reason that i did not do it is that I learned typescript and tailwind 
after starting this project.



the pages section includes 2 public/unprotected routes 

1. blogs -> to read blogs
2. projects -> to acces my projects which further will include the github link to mmy project and the live link to that particular project.

Most of the components are reusable and are located in the components folder.

any other updates will be posted timely.
